# Free Code Camp Zipline Use the Twitchtv JSON API Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find the most recent version of the guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

You can see the [demo](http://codepen.io/DawChihLiou/full/GjzqZo) on CodePen.

# Introduction
This [Free Code Camp challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api) is developed with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). It also depends on the following javascript libraries
```
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "react-scripts": "0.6.1",
    "redux-logger": "^2.7.2"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "es6-promise": "^4.0.5",
    "isomorphic-fetch": "^2.2.1",
    "react": "^15.3.2",
    "react-dom": "^15.3.2",
    "react-redux": "^4.4.5",
    "redux": "^3.6.0",
    "redux-thunk": "^2.1.0"
  }
}
```
It is a React + Redux exercise. The purpose is to understand how does Redux work with React. This exercise demonstrates how to deal with synchronous and asynchronous actions in Redux and how to render React components with Redux state.

The Twitchtv application has two features: filter and a list of visible Twitchtv channels. The application fetches Twitchtv channels on page load. You can filter the list based on online/offline status.
